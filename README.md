# COP4533 – Programming Project Milestone 1: Greedy Algorithms

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes two greedy algorithms for special cases of the **Vault Selection Problem**, as part of the COP4533 course.  
Given `n` vaults, each with a value, the goal is to select a subset of vaults such that no two chosen vaults are within `k` positions of each other while maximizing total value.

Milestone 1 focuses on the **design, correctness, and experimental study** of greedy algorithms for two simplified cases:

- **Problem S1:** Vault values are sorted in **non-decreasing order**.  
- **Problem S2:** Vault values are **unimodal** (first decreasing, then increasing).
